Describe in how the CSP was formulated, namely the variables, domains, and constraints considered.

R1: The problem has as inputs the rooms available, the timetable slots, the student classes, the weekly
classes and a respective set of associations between student classes and courses.
The variables are the weekly classes, each can be assigned to a room and a timetable slot. The domain 
consists of the all the possible combinations of rooms and timetables. We implemented that with an array
of tuples indexed by timetables. The graph was implemented as a dictionary of lists in which every node has
a list for every other node. Associations were implemented in a 

The constraints (3 in total) are that each room can only hold 1 class at a time, each student can only attend a single class at a time
and that no two weekly classes of the same course may occur on the same day.


Indicate which heuristics and constraint propagation (inference) methods were used,
and justify your choice.
